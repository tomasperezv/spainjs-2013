Cross-platform application development
======================================

Code examples and resources, for 'Cross-platform application development using web technologies', talk presented at [SpainJS](http://spainjs.org/).

This talk presents how Spotify uses web technologies to develop and maintain key features in the different platforms .
Hybrid apps is a hot topic nowadays, and we will explain how our architecture abstracts a web developer from the platform, making it possible to share code across multiple devices.

In the second part of the talk we will describe the architecture of the Spotify Embedded Platform, that allows external developers to include spotify entities inside their webpages, including a technology for remote controlling spotify clients, the webplayer and the desktop client.
